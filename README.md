# Python_data_structures
Here is the different methods and fuctionality of data structure in python
Here's the definition, advantages, disadvantages, and documentation site for the built-in data structures in Python:

Lists:
Definition: A list is an ordered, mutable, and heterogeneous collection of elements, which can be of any type. Lists are defined using square brackets [].
Advantages:
- Lists are versatile data structures that can hold any type of elements.
- Lists are ordered, so you can access elements in a specific order.
- Lists are mutable, so you can add, remove, or modify elements after the list is created.
- Lists have built-in functions and methods that make it easy to perform common operations.
Disadvantages:
- Lists are not efficient when it comes to searching or retrieving elements.
- Lists can consume a lot of memory if they have a large number of elements.

Tuples:
Definition: A tuple is an ordered, immutable, and heterogeneous collection of elements, which can be of any type. Tuples are defined using parentheses ().
Advantages:
- Tuples are ordered, so you can access elements in a specific order.
- Tuples are immutable, so you can ensure that the elements are not changed once the tuple is created.
- Tuples are used in cases where the data should be protected from accidental modification.
- Tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries, since they are hashable.
Disadvantages:
- Tuples are not mutable, so you cannot add, remove, or modify elements after the tuple is created.
- Tuples are less versatile than lists, as they are immutable.

Dictionaries:
Definition: A dictionary is an unordered, mutable, and associative collection of key-value pairs. Dictionaries are defined using curly braces {}.
Advantages:
- Dictionaries are efficient when it comes to searching or retrieving elements, as they use a hash table to store data.
- Dictionaries allow you to associate keys with values, making it easy to store and access data.
- Dictionaries are mutable, so you can add, remove, or modify elements after the dictionary is created.
Disadvantages:
- Dictionaries are unordered, so you cannot access elements in a specific order.
- Dictionaries have a fixed size, so you cannot increase or decrease the size of a dictionary once it is created.

Sets:
Definition: A set is an unordered, mutable, and heterogeneous collection of unique elements, which can be of any type. Sets are defined using the set keyword.
Advantages:
- Sets are efficient when it comes to checking if an element is present in the set, as they use a hash table to store data.
- Sets store only unique elements, so you can use them to get rid of duplicate data.
- Sets are mutable, so you can add, remove, or modify elements after the set is created.
Disadvantages:
- Sets are unordered: Unlike lists and tuples, sets are unordered, which means that the items have no index or specific position in the set.
- Sets are not suitable for indexing: Since sets are unordered, they are not suitable for indexing or slicing.
- Sets are not suitable for complex mathematical operations: Sets are not equipped to perform complex mathematical operations like dot product, cross product, etc.
Documentation: The official documentation for sets in Python can be found at the following link: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set

Strings:
Definition: A string is a sequence of characters in a specific order. Strings are immutable, which means you can not change the characters within a string once it's created. Strings are created using quotes either single or double.
Advantages:
- Strings are easy to use: Strings are very easy to use and understand, making them a great choice for storing text data.
- Strings are widely supported: Strings are supported by many programming languages, making them a universal data type.
- Strings are efficient: Strings are implemented in a way that makes them very efficient in terms of performance.
Disadvantages of Strings:
- Strings are immutable: Once you create a string, you can not change the characters within the string.
- Strings are memory-intensive: Strings can be memory-intensive, especially when dealing with large amounts of text data.
